# Potential Invention / Travel Pins Map

An interactive map to track places you have visited or want to visit, built using `ipyleaflet` and `ipywidgets` in Python. Pins can be added, updated, and deleted directly on the map, with persistent storage in a JSON file.

## Features

- Add pins on the map in **Add Pin** mode.  
- Each pin has a **name** and **status** ("Visited" or "Want to visit").  
- Click on a pin to **update**, **delete**, or **cancel** changes.  
- Pins are saved to a local JSON file (`travel_pins.json`).  
- Legend shows color coding for pin statuses.  
- Log output displays actions performed (add/update/delete/save).

## Installation

bash
pip install ipyleaflet ipywidgets
Note: Make sure you are using a Jupyter environment (Notebook or Lab) to run the map.

## Usage

Clone the repository.

Open the notebook containing the code.

Use the âž• Add Pin button to enable pin placement on the map.

Click an existing pin to edit or delete it.

Use Save pins to file button to store changes in travel_pins.json.

## Color Legend

Red: Visited

Green: Want to visit

## How It Works

Pins are represented as CircleMarkers on an ipyleaflet map.

A MarkerCluster is used to manage multiple pins efficiently.

Pin data is loaded from and saved to a JSON file, allowing persistence between sessions.

Clicking on a pin opens an interactive popup with controls for editing.

Map interactions are handled using on_interaction events.

## Next Steps

Add filtering or search functionality.

Customize marker icons or sizes.

Integrate with an online backend for multi-user access.

Enable importing/exporting pin data.
